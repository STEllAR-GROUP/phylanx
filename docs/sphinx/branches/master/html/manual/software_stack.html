<p>HPX is an asynchronous many-task runtime system capable of
running scientific applications both on a single process as
well as in a distributed setting on thousands of nodes.
In this project, we use HPX as an execution engine
which schedules tasks created by <em>Phylanx</em> and
manages the required task synchronization both
locally and in a distributed setting. To learn more

<h2>Frontend<a class="headerlink" href="#frontend" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Phylanx frontend provides two essential functionalities:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Transform the python code into a Phylanx internal representation called
PhySL (Phylanx Specification Language).</p></li>
<li><p>Copy-free handling of data objects between Python and Phylanx executor
(in C++).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the frontend exposes two main functionalities of
Phylanx that are implemented in C++ and required for
generation and evaluation of the execution
tree in Python. These functions are the <em>compile</em> and
<em>eval</em> methods.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Code Transformation</strong> - Performance benefits of many-task
runtime systems,
like HPX, are more prominent when the compute loads
of the system exceeds the available resources. Therefore,
using these runtimes for sections of a program which
are not computationally intensive may result in little
performance benefit. Moreover, the overhead of code
transformation and inherent extraneous work
imposed by runtime systems may even cause performance
degradation. Therefore, we have opted to limit our
optimizations to performance critical parts of the code
which we call computational <em>kernels</em>. The Phylanx frontend
provides a decorator <em>&#64;Phylanx</em> to trigger transformation
of kernels into the
execution tree.</p>
<p>We have developed a custom internal representation of Python AST in order to
facilitate the analysis of static optimizations and streamline the generation of the
execution tree. The human-readable version of the AST, aka PhySL, is
automatically generated and compiled into the execution tree by the frontend.
More details on this compilation process can be found in~ref{subsec:exe_tree}.
The benefit of
using PhySL as the intermediate representation is twofold: (1) it closely
reflects the nodes of the execution tree as each PhySL node represents a
function that will be run by an HPX task during evaluation, and (2) it can be
used for debugging and analyzing purposes for developers interested in custom
optimizations.</p>
<p>The compiled kernel is cached and can be invoked directly in Python or in
other kernels.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Data Management</strong> - Phylanx’s data structures rely on
the high-performance open-source C++ library
<a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/blaze-lib/blaze/src/master/">Blaze</a>.
Blaze already supports HPX as a parallelization
library backend and it perfectly maps its data to Python data
structures. Each Python list is mapped to a C++ <em>vector</em>
and 1-D and 2-D NumPy arrays are mapped to a
Blaze vector and Blaze matrix respectively. To
avoid data copies between Python and C++, we
take advantage of Python buffer protocol through
the pybind11 library. Figure~ref{fig:phylanxarch} shows how
Phylanx manages interactions with external libraries.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="execution-tree">
<h2>Execution Tree<a class="headerlink" href="#execution-tree" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>After the transformation phase, the frontend passes
the generated AST to the Phylanx compiler to construct
the execution tree where nodes are <em>primitives</em> and
edges represent dependencies between parents and
children pairs.</p>
<p>Primitives are the cornerstones of the Phylanx toolkit
and building blocks of the Phylanx execution tree.
Primitives are C++ objects which contain a single execute
function. This function is wrapped in a <em>dataflow</em> and can
be as simple as a single instruction or as complex as a
sophisticated algorithm. We have implemented and
optimized most Python constructs as well as many
NumPy methods as primitives. Futurization and asynchronous
execution of tasks are enabled through these constructs.
One can consider primitives as lightweight tasks that
are mapped to HPX threads. Each primitive accepts a
list of futures as its arguments and returns the
result of its wrapped function as a future.
In this way, the primitive can accept both constant
values known at compile time as well as the results
of previous primitives known only after being computed.</p>
<p>Upon the invocation of a kernel, Phylanx triggers
the evaluation function of the root node. This node
represents the primitive corresponding to the
result of the kernel. In the evaluation function,
the root node will call the evaluation function of
all of its children and those primitives will call the
evaluation functions of their children. This process
will continue until the leaf nodes have been
reached where the primitives evaluation functions
do not depend on other primitives to be resolved
(e.g. a primitive which is a constant, a primitive
which reads from a file, etc.). It is important to note
that it does not matter where each primitive is
placed in a distributed system as HPX will resolve
its location and properly call its eval function as well as
return the primitive’s result to the caller.</p>
<p>As the leaf primitives are reached and their values,
held in futures, are returned to their parents,
the tree will unravel at the speed of the
critical path through the tree. The results from
each primitive satisfy one of the inputs of its
parent node. After the root primitive finishes
its execution, the result of the entire tree
is then ready to be consumed by the calling
function.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="instrumentation">
<h2>Instrumentation<a class="headerlink" href="#instrumentation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Application performance analysis is a critical part
of developing a parallel application. Phylanx
enables performance analysis by providing performance
counters to provide insight into its intrinsics.
<em>Time</em> performance counters show the amount of
time that is spent executing code in each subtree of
the execution tree, and <em>count</em> performance counters
show how many times an execution tree node is
executed. This data aides in identifying performance
hotspots and bottlenecks, which can either be
directly used by the users or fed
into APEX for adaptive load balancing. The data can also
be used by the visualization tools described in the next section.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="visualization-tools">
<h2>Visualization Tools<a class="headerlink" href="#visualization-tools" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Embedding annotations and measurements for
visualizations and performance
analysis within the runtime provides a
way to determine where performance bottlenecks
are occurring and to gain insight
into the resource management within the machines.
In the tree produced by the tool, nodes are
Phylanx primitives and edges show
parent/child relationships regarding how the
child was called. The nodes are
colored purple for the <em>inclusive time</em>, the total
time spent executing that primitive and its children.
A switch provided in the toolbox
allows for the user to switch from inclusive
time to <em>exclusive time</em>, the time spent executing
only that primitive. This allows for
identification of hotspots in the tree. Each primitive
can be executed asynchronously or synchronously
in the parent thread. This distinction is expressed
in dotted versus solid circles for nodes in the tree.
The tree is interactive, allowing users to drill
down and focus by expanding or collapsing tree nodes and
hover for more details. The visualization is linked
with a code view showing the Python source code
(the corresponding PhySL is shown as well). Hovering
over a node or line in one will highlight the
corresponding line or node in the other.</p>
