# Phylanx: An Asynchronous Distributed Array Computing Toolkit

Find our project website [here](http://phylanx.stellar-group.org/). This site provides an overview of the project as well 
as information on who we are and what we plan to do!

The [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/STEllAR-GROUP/phylanx) contiguous
integration service tracks the current build status for the master branch:

The [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/hkaiser/phylanx) contiguous
integration tracks the status for Windows builds using the native Visual
Studio toolchain:

The [Buildbot](http://ktau.nic.uoregon.edu:8020/tgrid) continuous integration
service tracks the current build status on several platforms and compilers:
